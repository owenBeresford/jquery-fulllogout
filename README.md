# jquery-fulllogout
UNKNOWN, i found this on my laptop, but it is my code

I created these files on this latop in 2017, I then forgot abut them.
It was august 2017, so I assume I was on holiday and sleeping less every one else.

I'm not sure this code is any use; principally due to the fact that you need to open winow using JS to be able to close them with JS

ASSERT: here are more docs

There is test script that shows expected usage (in /test/ surpisngly)
