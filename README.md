# jquery-fulllogout
UNKNOWN, i found this on my laptop in 2019, but it is my code

*I created these files on this latop in 2017*, I then forgot abut them.
It was august 2017, so I assume I was on holiday and sleeping less every one else.

I'm not sure this code is any use; principally due to the fact that you need to open tabs/windows using JS to be able to close them with JS

ASSERT: here are more docs [http://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/jQuery-global-logout]

There is test script that shows expected usage (in /test/ surpisngly)
